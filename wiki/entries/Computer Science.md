# Computer science
**Computer science** is the study of [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation"), [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation"), and [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-YorkDefinition-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-MITAutomated-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-DenningAutomated-3) Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"), [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation"), [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), and automation) to [practical disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science") (including the design and implementation of [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture") and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-6) Computer science is generally considered an area of [academic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research") and distinct from [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-DenningProgramming-7)

[Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") and [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") are central to computer science.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-8) The [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation") concerns abstract [models of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_computation "Models of computation") and general classes of [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") that can be solved using them. The fields of [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") and [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing [security vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) "Vulnerability (computing)"). [Computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science) "Computer graphics (computer science)") and [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry") address the generation of images.
