# React (JavaScript library)
**React** (also known as **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software")  [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end "Front end and back end")  [JavaScript library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library "JavaScript library")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-react-3) for building [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces "User interfaces") based on UI [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering "Component-based software engineering"). It is maintained by [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms "Meta Platforms") (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-6) React can be used as a base in the development of [single-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application "Single-page application"), mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js "Next.js"). However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model"), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-8)

### Declarative[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=React_(JavaScript_library)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Declarative")]

React adheres to the  [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming")  paradigm. Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with  [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-schwarzm%C3%BCller-9)

### Components[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=React_(JavaScript_library)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Components")]

React code is made of entities called  [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering "Component-based software engineering"). These components are reusable and must be formed in the SRC folder following the Pascal Case as its naming convention (capitalize camelCase). Components can be rendered to a particular element in the  [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model")  using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, one can pass the values between components through "props":[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#cite_note-10)
